# Welcome to the revent-api creation!

This docs will help you start your own python project with pyenv, poetry, docker and deploying this to heroku just like we did the first time.

Tools we are gonna use:

- [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) - To manage and set your python version

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) - To manage packages, dependency management

- [Direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) - To manage our virtual environment automatically

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - To create an image of your local setup and be able to run this anywhere

In order to be more practical, the individual installation of each tool and integration with the environment will have to be done by you via the links above.

Now that we have all the tools installed, let's follow the steps:

  1. Create your repository

  2. Clone the repository to your local workplace (we should have a .gitignore file and a README.md file)

  3. Install your python version using the terminal:

      ```bash
      pyenv install <version>
      ```

  4. Move to the project folder and create your first file (that dictates which version of python to use) by running:

        ```bash
        pyenv local <version>
        ```

      We have a new file now (.python-version) that will tell the version needed to run the app.

  5. Now we need to setup poetry so we can install packages, run:

        ```bash
        poetry init
        ```

      We can just *press Enter all the way* and configure things later.  
      Now we have a new file(pyproject.toml) which will tell us what the app's dependencies are (for now just python).

  6. Poetry also has a great feature, he creates a new virtual environment (if you don't have one) that we are gonna ignore for now:  
    Start by installing the current dependencies:

      ```bash
      poetry install
      ```

      Your current project now has a new file called poetry.lock with the installed dependencies and respective versions.

      But we don't wanna have to activate this virtual environment everytime we come to work in the project, instead we are gonna use direnv!

  7. Since you already have direnv installed and hooked into your shell, start by creating a .envrc file with the following:

      ```bash
      layout pyenv <version>
      ```

      Just change the "version" to your python version. Everytime you change .envrc file you will have to allow this change with **`direnv allow`**

      Through the terminal, leave the project folder and come back in to see your new virtual environment.

  8. To set your interpreter to use this new path, run:

        ```bash
        poetry env info --path
        ```

      Copy this path, add in the end of it /bin/python and if your are using vscode, go to settings and search for python interpreter.
      Now select to use a specific path and use the one you just copy. Press Enter and you'r done! Now vscode will use this one.

  9. Add .envrc and .direnv to your .gitignore file

  10. Install the packages:

        ```bash
        poetry add Django
        ```

        ```bash
        poetry add strawberry-graphql
        ```

        ```bash
        poetry add isort
        ```

        ```bash
        poetry add gunicorn
        ```

        ```bash
        poetry add django-environ
        ```

      And so on... notice that the last package we installed is one that will allow us to use .env files to hide our secrets!

  11. Create the django app:

      ```bash
      django-admin startproject <name_of_project> .
      ```

      You shuld now have a folder with the name you choosed and a manage.py at the same level of other configuration files we created so far.

  12. Create your .env file and place your SECRET_KEY from project settings in there using [django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

      - On settings.py:

        ```python
        import environ
        import os
        env = environ.Env()
        BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
        environ.Env.read_env(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '.env'))
        SECRET_KEY = env('SECRET_KEY')
        ```

      - On your .env file you just save the same value you had on settings:

        - Example:

            ```python
            SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-+*(rklewjnr(klwnr0a70=ju^z)6$nujmo213po12341'
            ```

      - add .env to your .gitignore file

  13. Start your django app

      ```bash
      python manage.py startapp <name_of_app>
      ```

  14. Create a view on your app that looks like this:

      - The import:

        ```python
        from django.http import HttpResponse
        ```

      - The method:

        ```python
        def hello(request):
          return HttpResponse("Hello Runtime")
        ```

  15. On your project folder, go to urls.py and add this:

        - Import:

          ```python
          from <appname> import views
          ```

        - On urlpatterns add: `path('', views.hello, name='hello')`

  16. Now we can run the app and see a "Hello Runtime" already!

        - On settings.py add `'*'` to your allowed hosts.

        - Run:

            ```bash
            python manage.py runserver
            ```

        - Go to your browser and check the link provided by the command above.

  17. Create a file called Makefile and add this command plus future commands there. Check example [here](https://makefiletutorial.com/).

  18. To build a docker image of your current project, start by creating a file called 'Dockerfile' and one '.dockerignore'

        - For Dockerfile we are using this configuration:

          ```Dockerfile
          # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
          FROM python:3

          ARG DJANGO_ENV

          ENV DJANGO_ENV=${DJANGO_ENV} \
            # python:
            PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 \
            PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
            PYTHONHASHSEED=random \
            # pip:
            PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off \
            PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=on \
            PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=100 \
            # poetry:
            POETRY_VERSION=1.1.13 \
            POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE=false \
            POETRY_CACHE_DIR='/var/cache/pypoetry'

          # System deps:
          RUN apt-get update \
            && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
              bash \
              build-essential \
              curl \
              gettext \
              git \
              libpq-dev \
              wget \
            # Cleaning cache:
            && apt-get autoremove -y && apt-get clean -y && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
            && pip install "poetry==$POETRY_VERSION" && poetry --version

          # set work directory
          WORKDIR /code

          # Copy only requirements to cache them in docker layer
          COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml /code/

          # Install dependencies:
          RUN poetry install

          # Creating folders, and files for a project:
          COPY . /code

          # run gunicorn
          CMD gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
          ```

        - For our .dockerignore file we use this one:

          ```.dockerignore
          *.md
          .direnv
          .envrc
          .gitignore

          db.sqlite3
          ```

        - Just for us to see something on the browser we will also create a file called docker-compose.yml with the following:

          ```docker-compose
          version: '3.9'

          services:
            web:
              build: .
              command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
              ports:
                - 8000:8000
          ```

        - Build the image running the docker build command:

          ```bash
          docker build -t project:latest .
          ```

        - Once this finishes run the docker-compose to open your web service:

          ```bash
          docker-compose up
          ```

  19. Now that u seen your application running through docker let's deploy our app to heroku. Start by:

      1. Comment out docker-compose file and prepare our deploy for heroku creating a file heroku.yml with:

          ```heroku.yml
          build:
            docker:
              web: Dockerfile
          run:
            web: gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
          ```

      2. Change the gunicorn command on dockerfile to this:

          ```dockerfile
          CMD gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
          ```

      3. Add .env to .dockerignore because we can't send this environment variables to remote.

      4. On settings.py change DEBUG to False.

  20. Everything is ready, create an account on heroku and install [Heroku-CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

  21. Now that we got Heroku installed, follow the next commands:

      1. heroku login into your account

          ```bash
          heroku login
          ```

      2. heroku create app (you will get a random name like limitless-atoll-51647)

          ```bash
          heroku create
          ```

      3. Add the SECRET_KEY environment variable to your app:

          ```bash
          heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=SOME_SECRET_VALUE -a <randomAppName>
          ```

      4. In your settings.py change the allowed hosts from `'*'` to:

          `'localhost', '127.0.0.1', '<randomAppName>.herokuapp.com'`

      5. Set your app to be a cointainer:

          ```bash
          heroku stack:set container -a <randomAppName>
          ```

      6. Make your current git branch link to remote heroku

          ```bash
          heroku git:remote -a <randomAppName>
          ```

      7. Just push it! Note: You have to make your commit first if u havent done so.

          ```bash
          git add .
          ```

          ```bash
          git commit -am "Our first deploy"
          ```

          ```bash
          git push heroku <ourBranchName>:main
          ```

  22. Alright now you have your project setup done, we did build an image for docker and deploy on heroku! Go start coding and have fun :)
