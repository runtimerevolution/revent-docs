## How to create the project

Install the following:

[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

[next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

[jotai](https://jotai.org/docs/introduction)

```shell
npm install jotai
```

[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)

```shell
npm install react-hook-form
```

[react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/installation)

```shell
npm i react-query
```

In this step, if there are any errors, you might need to downgrade your react version to 17.0.2. To do this go to your `package.json` file and on the dependencies change react and react-dom value to `"17.0.2"`

[jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

```shell
npm install --save-dev jest
```

After the installation is complete:

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Visit  `http://localhost:3000` to view the application
- Start coding! :)



## Dockerfile setup

```shell
FROM node:16-alpine AS deps
```

Installs dependencies only when needed.

```shell
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
```

To add the missing shared libraries to your image, adding the libc6-compat package in your Dockerfile is recommended.

```shell
WORKDIR /app
```

Set the working directory to /app

```shell
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./ 
```

Copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

```shell
RUN npm ci
```

Installs all the exact version dependencies or devDependencies from a `package-lock.json` file

```shell
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
```

Rebuilds the source code only when needed

```shell
RUN npm run build
```

Creates a build directory with a production build of your app

```shell
FROM node:16-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
```

Production image, copy all the files and run next

```shell
ENV NODE_ENV production
```

Specifies the environment in which the application is running (usually, development or production)

```shell
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
```

Creates a group and an user

```shell
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
```

Copies the app public folder and `package.json` file

```shell
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static
```

Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size

```shell
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Sets up the USER and EXPOSE variables.

```shell
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Runs your app using `node server.js`.


## Heroku deploy

Since we already have a docker image, we can use it to deploy our app on heroku.

Log in to Container Registry
```shell
heroku container:login
```

Navigate to the appâ€™s directory and create a Heroku app:
```shell
heroku create
```

Build the image and push to Container Registry:
```shell
heroku container:push web
```

Then release the image to your app:
```shell
heroku container:release web
```

Now open the app in your browser:
```shell
heroku open
```
